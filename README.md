## Contributing

This is an open project for contribution however in all honesty it is not very practical to do so as the documentation lacks and there are manual steps to get the solution working. There are dependencies on AWS resources to allow local development which is bad practice.

It is therefore acknowledged at this point in the projects development that the best contributions will come from feature and improvement suggestions which can be done through the GitHub issues feature.

Development contribution is welcomed and there is [Documentation](Documentation\index.md) that is being created. Please contact `Fraser Molyneux` directly before contributing to better understand the solution.
